This is an implentation of a basic shell in C++. It includes foreground processes, piping, 
redirection of standard input and output, exit, wait, and cd.

* main.c : Writes the prompt "wsh: " to standard output.
           Reads a command line from standard input.
           Executes the command.
           Shows the status of background jobs (if any).
           If the end of standard output hasn't been reached, starts over.
			 
* foreground.c : Creates a new process using fork.
                 Redirects output to file if appropriate.
                 Replaces the image of the created process with the desired command using execvp.
                 Waits for the process to terminate.

* piped.c : Create a new process for each job using fork.
			Replace the image of each process with the appropriate executable using execlp or execvp.
			Create n-1 pipes using pipe.
			Re-direct the output of job i to the write end of pipe i.
			Re-direct the input of job i to the read end pipe i-1.
			Keep the input of job1 as standard input.
			Keep the output of jobn as standard output.
			Close any unnecessary file descriptors.
			Wait for all jobs to terminate.
